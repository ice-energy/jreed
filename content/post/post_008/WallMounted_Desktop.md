**Quick Summary:**  These are the specs and links for my Wall-Mounted Desktop.

## Motherboard

**DQ77KB**   [dq77kb](https://www.amazon.com/Intel-DQ77KB-Mini-ITX-BLKDQ77KB-1-Pack/dp/B00GJ5H0XK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1527289293&sr=8-1&keywords=dq77kb&dpID=51WruYmhyUL&preST=_SX300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch)

I worked a year at Intel in the *Digital Signage Lab*, and we used these boards to put systems together.
Everything you need in a very tight package.

## CPU

**Intel Core i7-3770K**  [i7-3770K](https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-3770K-Quad-Core-Processor-Cache/dp/B007SZ0EOW)

Quad Core, 8 CPU's.  3.5Ghz.   Folks, this chip is the *Real Deal*.  Get a big(ger) power supply!!  (See below)

OK here's the deal. The 3770S is the ideal part, but the 'K' will still work fine.   My 'K' worked out-of-the
box on the MotherBoard, but then I *upgraded the firmware*.   Don't do that.

> Newer firmware on the DQ77KB will reject the K.  I had to Downgrade the firmware.

## Fan

**Thermaltake Engine 27**  [engine27](https://www.amazon.com/Thermaltake-Engine-Low-Profile-Cooling-CL-P032-CA06SL/dp/B01MCT9V18)

This fan is super quiet, and it looks *friggin' awesome*.
A bit pricey, but worth it.
